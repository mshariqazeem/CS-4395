# CS-4395
This is a repository for class CS 4395: Human Language Technologies.

## Assignment 0 - Getting Started
**Description:** This is the first assignment for this course. In this document, I have given an overview of NLP, based on the first chapter of the book "Exploring NLP with Python" by Dr. Karen Mazidi.<br>
Click [here](Overview_of_NLP.pdf) to look at the document.

## Assignment 1 - Text Processing with Python
**Description:** This program reads input from a .csv file, specified in the sysarg, that contains a list of employees and their attributes. Then, it processes that data and saves the attributes of each person in a Person Object. Next, it adds each Person Object in a Persons dictionary. Then, it saves that dictionary into a pickle file. Lastly, it reads information from the pickle file and prints it on the screen.<br>
**How to run:**  First, download the .csv file and place it in a folder named data within the same folder as your Python program. Second, specify the relative path ‘data/data.csv’ in a sysarg. Lastly, add the .py file in the program and run it.<br>
**What I learned:** This is the first time I have written a Python program, so I learned a lot of things along the way. I learned how to define a class, how to create a function, how to read and process data from a file, and how to pickle and unpickle a file.<br>
**Strengths/Weaknesses of Python:** In my opinion, the text processing aspect of Python is similar to other languages I have used in the past. One thing that was new to me was the concept of regular exprerssion. It made it easier to compare the text with the valid format. That is not something that I have yet explored in other languages.<br>

## Assignment 2 - Exploring NLTK
**Description:** This assignment explores some methods and features of the NLTK Library.<br>

## Assignment 3 - Word Guessing Game
**Description:** This program finds the 50 most common nouns in a text file and creates a word guessing game using those nouns.<br>

## Assignment 4 - WordNet
**Description:** This assignment explores some features built in the WordNet Library.<br>
Click [here](WordNet.pdf) to look at the document.

## Assignment 5 - Ngrams
**Description:** This assignment consists of two programs.<br>
Program 1 reads multiple language documents and creates dictionaries of their unigrams and bigrams.<br>
Program 2 reads in the dictionaries and uses them to predict the language of each line of a test document. Then, it compares the predictions to the actual languages to calculate the accuracy of the algorithm.<br>
Click [here](ngrams.py) to look at Program 1.<br>
Click [here](language_classification.py) to look at Program 2.<br>
Click [here](Ngrams_Narrative.pdf) to look at a document discussing ngrams and their uses.

## Assignment 6 - Web Crawler
**Description:** This program crawls over a starter URL to find 15 relevant websites. Then, it scrapes all the text from those websites, and uses that text to build a knowledge base.<br>
Click [here](WebCrawler.py) to look at the code.<br>
Click [here](Knowledge_Base.pdf) to look at the Knowledge Base document.

## Assignment 7 - Sentence Parsing
**Description:** This program explores PSG, Dependency, and SRL parsers on a sentence, and lists each of their pros and cons.<br>

## Assignment 8 - Author Attribution
**Description:** This assignment perfroms Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network on a set of texts, to classify its author.<br>

## Assignment 9 - ACL Paper Summary
**Description:** This assignment looks at one of the papers published for the ACL Conference and summarizes the problem and solutions discussed in that paper.<br>

## Assignment 10 - Text Classification
**Description:** This assignment builds different models to perform text classification on a data set taken from Kaggle.<br>
