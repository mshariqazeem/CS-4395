This is a repository for class CS 4395: Human Language Technologies.

## Assignment 0 - Getting Started
**Description:** This is the first assignment for this course. In this document, I have given an overview of NLP, based on the first chapter of the book "Exploring NLP with Python" by Dr. Karen Mazidi.<br>

## Assignment 1 - Text Processing with Python
**Description:** This program reads input from a .csv file, specified in the sysarg, that contains a list of employees and their attributes. Then, it processes that data and saves the attributes of each person in a Person Object. Next, it adds each Person Object in a Persons dictionary. Then, it saves that dictionary into a pickle file. Lastly, it reads information from the pickle file and prints it on the screen.<br>
**How to run:**  First, download the .csv file and place it in a folder named data within the same folder as your Python program. Second, specify the relative path ‘data/data.csv’ in a sysarg. Lastly, add the .py file in the program and run it.<br>
**What I learned:** This is the first time I have written a Python program, so I learned a lot of things along the way. I learned how to define a class, how to create a function, how to read and process data from a file, and how to pickle and unpickle a file.<br>
**Strengths/Weaknesses of Python:** In my opinion, the text processing aspect of Python is similar to other languages I have used in the past. One thing that was new to me was the concept of regular exprerssion. It made it easier to compare the text with the valid format. That is not something that I have yet explored in other languages.<br>
